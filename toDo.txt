ToDo Before Summer Break:

Account Pol - Cross reference with other standards and test viability of setting with LGPO
Defensive Countermeasures - Switch script to importing reg keys instead of ps script, revamp existing tactics as well (less focus on this - only 0-1 vulns/box in semis the last 2 years)
OS Updates - Figure out how to speed up by downloading beforehand
Prohitibted Files/Software - Revamp baselines (again)
Service Auditing (MOST WORK REQUIRED) - Figure out what the heck are we missing?
Uncat OS Settings - Expand strategy past doing group pol (group pol covers the vulns from up to semis, but not in semis)
User Auditing - Create modified version of script for domain controllers



Summer Break and the Year:
- Labs for critical services and more automated configurations for the main ones (IIS/DC/DNS/SMB)
- More practice images
- RvB practice
